### Local Modifications (Tabs UI & Responsive)

This fork includes targeted fixes and enhancements to the Tabs UI and responsive behavior, designed to work in Docker with bind-mounted `interface/` and `templates/`.

Key changes by file:

- `interface/main/tabs/js/tabs_view_model.js`
  - Keep the active tab in the visible row during overflow recalculation.
  - Ensure at least one tab always remains visible.
  - Swap rule in `activateTab()` so a tab selected from ‚ÄúMore‚Äù moves into the visible row immediately.

- `templates/interface/main/tabs/tabs_template.html.twig`
  - Removed `with: tabs` scoping to avoid binding errors; now uses `tabs.visibleTabs`/`tabs.moreMenuVisible` directly.
  - Always render tab titles (no hidden labels when inactive).
  - ‚ÄúMore‚Äù dropdown items prevent default navigation and call `tabClicked` cleanly.

- `interface/main/tabs/main.php`
  - CSS to prevent dropdown clipping and to layer above surrounding UI.
  - ‚ÄúPortal to body‚Äù on open for the ‚ÄúMore‚Äù dropdown to escape stacking contexts (e.g., left menu), then restore on close.
  - Layout width set to 100% so tabs can overflow correctly.
  - Added cache-buster for `custom_bindings.js` to avoid stale caches on mobile.

- `interface/main/tabs/js/custom_bindings.js`
  - On same-origin tab content load, injects a viewport meta tag and small responsive CSS at `max-width: 992px`.
  - Equalizes 2‚Äì4 inline inputs (e.g., First/Middle/Last) using a CSS Grid helper (`.oemr-eq`), with delayed passes and resize handling.
  - Propagates the same injection into same-origin nested frames/iframes within tab content.

Changelog summary is kept in `CHANGELOG.md` in this directory.
